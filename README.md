Welcome to My Tech Final!

In this link you will see a map with the countries of the world and their average lifespans. The colors of the countries correspond to their rankings of their average lifespans. The dark green means that the country has a very high average lifespan, and the dark red means that the country has a very low average lifespan. The lighter colors mean that they are in between hgh and low: light green leans more toward a high average lifespan, and light red means that it leans toward a lower average lifespan.
